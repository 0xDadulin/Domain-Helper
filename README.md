Web application developed in Flask, providing domain analysis services like DNS lookup, SSL certificate verification, and WHOIS data retrieval. It employs a modular architecture with blueprints for organized routing and component logic. Utilizes libraries such as dns.resolver, ssl, and requests for domain analysis tasks, and facilitates user input through interactive forms, displaying results in dedicated views. The app implements error logging and function usage statistics to CSV files, and visualizes usage statistics using the Plotly library. It also manages session data to store user query history and validates domain formats for enhanced user experience.
